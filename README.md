# Object-Oriented-Python-Repo
Attached are my files for the assessment.
The code should scrape correctly and flow, however I have some issues that I need to discuss with an instructor about my program. 
Overall though, most of it should work. 
The python file contains all of the code necessary, while the json file contains the starting holiday dates.
