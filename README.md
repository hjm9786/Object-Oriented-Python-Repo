# Object-Oriented-Python-Repo
Attached are my files for the assessment.
The code should scrape correctly and flow, however I have some issues that I need to discuss with an instructor about my program. 
Overall though, most of it should work.

CHANGE LOG:

Added notebook file instead of the python one for syntax issue

Webscraping should add holidays

Saving should work

Issues:

Webscraping won't place holidays with the others in json file, instead appends them to the very end and causes issues

Same when adding to file

View holidays logic is a bit iffy, could use improvement.
