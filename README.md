# Object-Oriented-Python-Repo
Attached are my files for the assessment.
The code should scrape correctly and flow, however I have some issues that I need to discuss with an instructor about my program. 
Overall though, most of it should work.

CHANGE LOG:

Scraping, file IO, and saving all works now

Adding to holidays logic

Added decorator for removing holidays

Issues:

API intregration and viewing holidays functionality is very wonky/broken

Need to implement lambda function
